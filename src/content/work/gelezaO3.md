Geleza O3 is a water purification company, and I developed its official website to showcase the company’s services and streamline customer engagement. Built using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, the website features a responsive and user-friendly interface to enhance accessibility across devices.

The platform allows users to log in and access detailed information about the company and its offerings. It also integrates essential communication features, enabling users to send emails directly to the company, contact the business via WhatsApp, and even place orders seamlessly. By combining modern web design practices with functional capabilities, I ensured the website provides a professional, efficient, and engaging user experience while supporting the company's operational goals.
