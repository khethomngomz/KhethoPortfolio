I designed and developed the official website for Ezaga using Astro.js and Tailwind CSS, creating a modern, responsive platform tailored to the company's needs. The website features a clean and visually appealing design optimized for performance and usability.

Leveraging Astro.js for a fast, lightweight front-end architecture and Tailwind CSS for streamlined, customizable styling, I ensured the site delivers a seamless user experience across devices. This project highlights my ability to implement cutting-edge web technologies to craft efficient, scalable, and aesthetically pleasing digital solutions that align with business objectives.
