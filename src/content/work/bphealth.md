> Tell me and I forget. Teach me and I remember. Involve me and I learn.

As a Junior Full-Stack Developer on this project, I collaborated with senior developers to design and implement essential features, including creating responsive front-end interfaces using Angular and Bootstrap5. I contributed to building and maintaining Prisma schemas aligned with database structures and ensured smooth interaction with a PostgreSQL database.

In addition to developing and testing API endpoints to guarantee functionality and data integrity, I participated in backend architecture design, adhering to best practices for clean, maintainable code. Leveraging Git for version control and Trello for task management, I supported team collaboration and maintained project progress. This role provided me with hands-on experience in modern web development technologies, allowing me to deliver scalable, user-centric solutions.
